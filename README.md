A viewer for the UDP VIC video streaming function in the Ultimate 64!

I know this works on V1.21 -3.5a, it probably will work on newer, but maybe not older firmwares.

It listens for video on port 11000.

It listens for audio on port 11001.

This was written in 2 hours, then fixed the next day  for another two hours,  and I was tired, didn'tclean it up, don't care.

It does what I need, so it's done (tm).
