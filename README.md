WUT
===
A viewer for the UDP VIC video streaming function in the Ultimate 64!

I know this works on V1.21 -3.5a, it probably will work on newer, but maybe not older firmwares.

It listens for video on port 11000.

It listens for audio on port 11001.

Mac OSX ?
===================
I've been told that this builds and works fine on OSX, I don't have a mac, so you need to compile it yourself.

Alternatives?
=============
For Windows users there is also another Ultimate 64 viewer, called "U64 Streamer" made by Martijn Wieland (TSB), check it out at https://www.tsb.space/projects/u64-streamer/
