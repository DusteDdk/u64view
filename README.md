# u64view

Fork of https://github.com/dusteddk/u64view/

### Changes

- Use new U64 socket commands instead of simulating menu selection
- Reset command is now bound to keys F12 and Alt+r
- Quit command is now bound to keys Escape and Alt+q
- Other keypresses are passed on to the U64, based on mapping in [keys.h](keys.h).
