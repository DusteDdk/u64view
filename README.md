WUT
===
A viewer for the UDP VIC video streaming function in the Ultimate 64!
I know this works on V1.21 -3.5a, it probably will work on newer, but maybe not older firmwares.
It will listen on port 11000.

This was written in 2 hours, and I was tired, didn't even clean it up, I don't care!
It does what I need, so it's done (tm).
